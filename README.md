# Triangle Classifier

## Project Overview
This project implements a Python program to classify triangles based on their side lengths. The program determines whether a triangle is:
- Equilateral
- Isosceles
- Scalene
- Right triangle
- Not a triangle

Additionally, it includes automated test cases using the Pytest framework to verify the correctness of the implementation.

## Assignment Experience

### Challenges Encountered
1. **Understanding Triangle Classification Logic**:
   - Handling edge cases like ensuring the sides form a valid triangle (`"Not a triangle"`) was initially challenging.
   - Differentiating between various triangle types (e.g., equilateral vs. isosceles) required careful attention to conditional logic.

2. **Setting Up Pytest**:
   - Configuring the testing environment and understanding Pytest commands took some time. Once resolved, the tool proved efficient for validating the code.

3. **GitHub Integration**:
   - Linking the local repository to GitHub required troubleshooting an existing remote URL conflict. The issue was resolved by resetting the remote URL.

### Thoughts on the Requirements
- The requirements provided clear guidance on what to implement, test, and deliver.
- The focus on testing emphasized the importance of validating code through well-constructed test cases.
- Breaking the deliverables into distinct sections (code, test cases, and experience report) helped structure the work effectively.

### Challenges with Tools
- **VS Code**: Setting up the workspace correctly to run both the program and test cases took some time.
- **Pytest**: Understanding the syntax for asserting test cases and interpreting the output was a new but rewarding experience.
- **GitHub**: Initially, there was a minor issue with remote repository setup, which was resolved through troubleshooting.

### Criteria for Sufficient Test Cases
1. Five test cases were designed to cover:
   - Equilateral, Isosceles, Scalene, Right triangles, and invalid inputs (`Not a triangle`).
2. Edge cases were included, such as inputs where the sum of two sides equals the third side.
3. Running all test cases with Pytest returned a 100% success rate, demonstrating the code's correctness.
